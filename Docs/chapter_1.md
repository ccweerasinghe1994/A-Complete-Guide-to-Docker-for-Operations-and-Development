### Difference Between Containerization and Virtualization

`Virtual machines` represent `hardware-level` virtualization where one operating system
is downloaded on top of a `host` operating system. Therefore, they are `heavy` and `fully`
`isolated`. There is `no` availability for `SSH` or `TTY`, and they are fully `secured`.
On the other hand, `containers` represent operating system `virtualization`. You can
download as many different operating systems in containers as applications need.
`Containers` are `light` and `fast`; however, they are `not` fully `isolated` but `secure`
